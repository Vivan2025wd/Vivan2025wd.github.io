      "This is something I wanted to tell you for months now.",
      "So here it goes.",
      "The days we were still dating, I actually knew he liked you so I did tell you that, and then I somewhat thought he'd give you everything you wanted. So I told you that he liked you, and he did. And then the confession came and I realized if I pressured you to choose me, it wouldn't last long. You didnâ€™t want to choose either, so I let you goâ€”not out of hate nor spite. I wanted you to have a better life than I could give at that moment.",
      "After I stopped talking with you, I literally hated myself for letting you go because I genuinely loved and cared for you. Thereâ€™s a phrase that says youâ€™ll know you really loved someone when you let them go. I actually felt what they were trying to say. The only reason I could accept it is that I did it for your own good. So, I forgave myself eventually. But even though I did, there wasnâ€™t a day up until now that you havenâ€™t crossed my mind. Actually, Iâ€™ve been thinking about you like a madman. Not those things...only your happy face, the funny and silly video call moments. Those are the things that come to my mind when you cross my mind.",
      "When we were dating, you said that you wanted a six-pack, and that Iâ€™d have to buy a beach if you wanted to wear a bikini. You also said I could become filthy rich. And about the filthy rich part, Iâ€™m on my way there. And as for six-packs...I only have genetics for a 4-pack.",
      "The day you posted your first couple photo and when I saw that on your WhatsApp status, it really felt like a stab. I never felt that much pain, but I accepted the fact that you were gone. And when you talked like that in the Aissa group, it really felt like stabbing. Well, you know how to hurt me... I give credit to you for that.",
      "But after 8 months passed, I realized how much you meant to me. I tried dating after a few months, trying to move on, but I literally can't. My heart wonâ€™t let you go. No matter how hard I tried, it just wonâ€™t happen.",
      "Iâ€™ll be really honestâ€”the reason why I liked you in the first place is because the day we first met at the Aissa Expo, and do you remember you fed me, and I fed you too? Your energy and character are the reason I liked you in the first place. Well, you were the most beautiful girl thereâ€”that's true too. But above it all, what I truly liked about you was how you acted like a girlâ€”feminine. Thatâ€™s what I loved and liked about you. And you're stronger than I am. You're brave for carrying so much on your mind and shoulders. I admire you for your confidence, and I love the way you dress. Sure, itâ€™s tempting, and turns heads aroundâ€”gives off a model vibe.",
      "When you told me you wanted to be a model, I genuinely believed that you could become one because of your body shape, your confidence, and your strength to do things alone. After we stopped talking, I copied that trait from you, and now Iâ€™m stubborn as hell. And confident too.",
      "When we split, I wasnâ€™t sure what Iâ€™d do, but after coming this far and changing myself completely, what I only realized is I only want you to be a part of my life, not anyone else.",
      "So the day I said I loved you and cared about you, I literally meant it. And I still keep the promises I made to you that night. Sure, some of them canâ€™t be kept with you not in my life, but others still apply.",
      `Here are the promises I'm giving you:<ul class="promise-list">
        <li>1. I won't ever leave you.</li>
        <li>2. I won't hurt you consciously.</li>
        <li>3. I won't hold anything against you.</li>
        <li>4. I'll be with you until the day we die.</li>
        <li>5. I'll always try to solve the argument.</li>
        <li>6. I won't ever use your past to hurt you.</li>
        <li>7. I will always unconditionally love you.</li>
        <li>8. I will be the best version of me.</li>
        <li>9. I'll try my best not to hurt you.</li>
        <li>10. I'll always protect you.</li>
        <li>11. I won't ever leave you alone at night.</li>
        <li>12. I won't ever talk about breaking up.</li>
      </ul>`,
      "Iâ€™ve kept these promises to this day:",
      "1. Even though I left you physically, I still kept you in my heart, and no one has been able to remove you from there.",
      "2. I never hurt you consciously, and I never will.",
      "3. I only hold love and care, and nothing else towards you.",
      "4. If you allow it, I will be with you.",
      "5 & 6. I still do and always will.",
      "7. Unconditionally is the word for what I feel. Even if you hate me or despise me, I love you unconditionally, and I still keep that to this day.",
      "8. To be honest, I became my best version because of you, and I still keep improving.",
      "9 & 10. I do, and I still do.",
      "About #11: After we stopped talking, I couldnâ€™t sleep because I knew you couldn't sleep alone at night. So I was up all nights till dawn, hoping if you sent a message or called, I would be able to pick it up.",
      "So, I know this won't change the past or what happened, but you said today that youâ€™ve put the past behind. I did the same too, but the memories, the time I spent with you, the days I had you in my life, they are too precious to leave behind. And the way you made me feel about lifeâ€”you brought color to my life. How could I let something like that stay in the past? Even if youâ€™re a ghost from the past and I live in the future, Iâ€™ll always keep you by my side. That's what I realized. The past couple of months have been intense, trying not to reach out or think about you. I did that for months, and I just can't live this way. So this is some of the things I wanted to say to you but couldnâ€™t.",
      "There are so many things I wanna tell you. And if I get the chance, I would live 1,000 years, noâ€”âˆž years with you because thatâ€™s how much you mean to me... and meant to me..."
